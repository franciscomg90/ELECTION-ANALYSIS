# ELECTION-ANALYSIS

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to get a complete election audit which results will sort by county and candidate the total votes and percentage of each one as well as the winner of both categories.

## Election Audit Results
>Total vote count might be the easiest calc made in this excersise using just a for loop in the csv file till the last filled row.

>County votes segregation was a bit more complicated since I needed to declare several variables trough the code and calculate total by each county and percentage, but county code was very similar to candidate process.
