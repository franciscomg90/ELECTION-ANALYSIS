# ELECTION-ANALYSIS

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to get a complete election audit which results will sort by county and candidate the total votes and percentage of each one as well as the winner of both categories.

## Election Audit Results
>**_Total vote count_** might be the easiest calc made in this excersise using just a for loop in the csv file till the last filled row.

>**_County votes segregation_** was a bit more complicated since I needed to declare several variables through the code and calculate total  and percentage for each county, but as well as the total votes calc, "for" iterations works great for this purpose.
